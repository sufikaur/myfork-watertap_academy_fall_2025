    "# Surrogate modeling for corrosion constraints in a WaterTAP MVC model\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to build surrogate models for general and localized corrosion design constraints and how to integrate these surrogate models in a WaterTAP model of mechanical vapor compression (MVC) system treating seawater <sup id=\"cite_ref-1\"><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">1</a></sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "MVC is typically used to treat high salinity feeds. In MVC systems, the evaporator capital cost accounts for approximately 30% of the levelized cost of water (LCOW) and is highly dependent on the material used. The evaporator requires a material that can resist corrosion at high salinities and temperaures, but more corrosion-resistant materials are more expensive. There is a need to select the most cost-effective material that still provides sufficient corrosion resistance. Because the underlying physics of corrosion are highly complex, we use surrogate models to predict general and localized corrosion in the MVC evaporator and inform the cost-optimal design and operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "This notebook breaks down the three primary steps for developing surrogate models for corrosion and incorporating them in a WaterTAP model: \n",
    "1. Data generation of corrosion metrics\n",
    "2. Fitting corrosion surrogate models\n",
    "3. Integrating corrosion design constraints\n",

    "For a material to be considered corrosion resistant, we assume the following two constraints must be satisfied:\n",
    "1. Corrosion rate is less than a maximum corrosion rate of 0.1 mm/yr (sufficiently low general corrosion): $$CR \\leq CR_{max}$$\n",
    "2. The repassivation potential is greater than the corrosion potential (conservative prediction of no localized corrosion): $$V_{rp}-V_{c} \\geq 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We used [OLI Systems' Corrosion Analyzer](https://www.olisystems.com/software/oli-studio/oli-studio-corrosion-analyzer/) to predict corrosion rate $CR$, repassivation potential $V_{rp}$, and corrosion potential $V_{c}$ data under different operating conditions relevant to the evaporator in MVC. \n",
    "\n",
    "We considered the following ranges of inputs:\n",
    "* Temperature: 25-95 C (15 samples)\n",
    "* pH: 4-8 (9 samples)\n",
    "* Recovery: 0-80% (17 samples)\n",
