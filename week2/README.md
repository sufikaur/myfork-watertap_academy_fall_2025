# Materials for week 2
* **`RO_flowsheet_build.ipynb`:** workflow for constructing a full reverse osmosis flowsheet. 
* **`intro_to_property_packages.ipynb`:** introduction to property models using a simple flowsheet that only contains a feed stream.
* **`unit_model_configuration.ipynb`:** introduction to unit model configuration arguments, which tailor the model for a specific application.

# Post-session Exercise
* **`RO_flowsheet_with_ERD_build.ipynb`:** post-session exercise to construct your own reverse osmosis flowsheet while adding also adding an energy recovery device. This exercise builds on lessons learned in **`RO_flowsheet_build.ipynb`:** 
* **`touching_properties.ipynb`:** demonstration of solving a model with and without touching properties first.
