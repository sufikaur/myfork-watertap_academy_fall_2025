    "# Touching Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a quick demonstration of what can happen if you don't \"touch\" properties prior to solving the model and further explanation of when touching property variables is necessary. \"Touching\" a property is simply a line of code that attempts to access the desired property. For example, \"touching\" osmotic pressure is simply, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    m.fs.unit.properties[0].pressure_osm_phase\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration is for `pressure_osm_phase`, but other properties in the seawater property model that would require touching are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    mass_frac_phase_comp\n",
    "    dens_mass_phase_comp\n",
    "    dens_mass_solvent\n",
    "    flow_vol_phase\n",
    "    flow_vol\n",
    "    conc_mass_phase_comp\n",
    "    visc_d_phase\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To touch *indexed* variables (e.g., `conc_mass_phase_comp`), touching with any index (or no index) will have the same effect. For example, the following two lines of code are equivalent for the purposes of touching `conc_mass_phase_comp`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "    m.fs.unit.properties[0].conc_mass_phase_comp\n",
    "    m.fs.unit.properties[0].conc_mass_phase_comp[\"Liq\", \"TDS\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, touching property variables is not necessary for unit model state blocks that use the property. For example, the RO model requires the use of `pressure_osm_phase` on the *inlet* stream so you would not need to touch that property for that state block. *But*, if you were interested in knowing the osmotic pressure of the permeate stream, you would need to touch the property on the permeate state block prior to solving."
